                        <li>Access to step-by-step guidance and resources for validating your idea.</li>
                        <li>Lots of networking possibilities with other active problem-solvers. Maybe one of them will join your team?</li>

                    <h3>Who are we looking for?</h3>
                    <p>This Studio is open to anyone who would like to create solutions solving local and global problems. Whether you already have an idea or not, you can join the Studio and connect with other problem-solvers. Starting off, youâ€™ll go through ideation and teambuilding, and once you have a team and an idea (or if you already have them to start with), youâ€™ll proceed to validate it.</p>
                    <p>The first two stages of the Studio are open to anyone based in Finland, but if you wish to continue to the following stages, youâ€™ll need to have at least one team member from the Aalto community (student, researcher, staff, alumni).</p>

                <div class="info">
                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>The Studio includes four stages, each stage answering a fundamental question about your idea:</p>
                    <p>Stage 0: What impact do I want to make?</p>
                    <p>Stage 1: How do I validate the problem I want to solve?</p>
                    <p>Stage 2: How do I bring my solution into reality?</p>
                    <p>Stage 3: Iâ€™ve built my first version of the solution! How do I keep it viable?</p>
                    <p>Each stage provides a list of practical checkpoints to accomplish to proceed through a stage and a curated list of resources that help you carry out the tasks. Every two weeks, you will be meeting with your peers and Studio coaches to discuss the progress and challenges. In the later stages, you will also get one-on-one mentoring possibilities.</p>
                    <p>After completing each stage, you will reflect on your progress and plans and decide whether you want to proceed with your current idea or maybe repeat the process with another one. Or perhaps youâ€™ll decide to combine forces with some other future founders in solving an altogether different challenge. The decision is yours!</p>
